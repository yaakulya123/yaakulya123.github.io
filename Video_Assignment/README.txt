Project Name: Rhythm Perspectives: A Student Guide to Drumming

Project Description: We chose the third option on the assignment description to create the theme of our project. The project aims to show users how to play a simple drum grove using three basic steps. The project includes a video of a drummer describing his journey to playing drums. The video is hosted on a webpage where users can ask questions and have an interactive experience.

Process:

The first step is to create a storyline and a script. Creating the storyline and the script was not difficult since most of the content o the film is not fictional. Once the story was created the next step and most important one was to shoot the video. We chose a music practice room in the art center to center to get access to a drum set. Once we chose a good location to start we used a black magic camera to film different scenes. To facilitate the editing process we extracted the footage from the SD card and employed iMovie as our editing software. Furthermore, we have incorporated pre-design templates from pixels.com to create captivating intro and outro slides for our screens. For creating the webpage we used HTML, CSS, and javascript. We used HTML to create the skeleton of the page and CSS to make the page look good. Javascript was mainly used for interactivity purposes. Implementing the interactive elements, such as the "click me" button and the question page, adds a personalized and engaging experience for users. JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js are utilized to handle interactivity effectively. Developing the interactive elements was very complex. Allowing users to resume watching the video after answering the questions adds continuity to the interactive experience. Managing the navigation flow and properly resuming the video at the correct point was challenging to implement. Careful scripting and testing was done to ensure a seamless transition from the question page back to the video playback. Handling video playback controls, and pausing and resuming video at specific points were all implemented. Automatically redirecting users to the last page of the website after video completion provides a sense of closure and allows for a final call to action or conclusion. Coordinating the video playback duration with the redirection to the last page was a bit tricky Finally, we have used Git Large File System to push the video files to Git Hub since almost all video files are more than 100MB.

Reflection:
We believe we have satisfied most of the requirements and goals of our site. We have incorporated different techniques coupled with a good editing process. We believe the video has clearly shown the three basic steps required to play a simple drum grove. Moreover, the interactive elements of the site where the user can ask the drummer questions have given the user an engaging experience. However, our site has one main limitation. Currently, we are using the git large file system to store the videos and the free account limits the amount of bandwidth one can use for free. Therefore to support a robust and full-scale functionality we might have to consider other options such as hosting the video on youtube or buying more bandwidth from the git large file system.
